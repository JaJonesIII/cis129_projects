print("Two friends out to enjoy eachothers company and all the lake has to offer.")
print("Not another person in sight. Just the sounds of ducks making their way around the lake")
print("The two friends set up their boat and begin trolling around the lake. They begin casting their lines and start to catch fish.")
print("After six hours on the lake and a stringer full of fish, they decide to pack up and make their way home and have a delicious dinner.")
